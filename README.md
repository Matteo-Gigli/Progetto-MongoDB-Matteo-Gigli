1 The platform must provide an endpoint to manage user registration and access.

2 Automatically assigns to each registered user a variable amount between 1 and 10 bitcoins.

3 Each user can publish one or more orders to sell or buy a certain amount of bitcoin at a certain price.

4 At the time of publication, if the purchase price of the order is equal to or higher than the sale price of any other user, register the transaction and mark both orders as executed.

5 Provide an endpoint to get all active buy and sell orders.

6 Also provide an endpoint to calculate the total profit or loss from each user's operations.

7 It assumes that the platform in question is totally free for users and does not retain any type of commission on operations.
